# About

Bloxy is a module for interacting with the [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) website and its API.

### Other (not-that-important) information
Welcome, and thank you for using bloxy.
It is a module I've spent a long time creating, to make it easier for both novice and experienced NodeJS developers to interact with the Roblox website, and its API, without creating their own module.
You are free to use this as you'd like.

Before you start using this module, I strongly recommend you to read the documentation for it, so you get to know how this module operates, and that you can see the parameters for each function, see all the classes' properties and methods, and stream events.

Bloxy was created since [roblox-js](https://github.com/sentanos/roblox-js) is not fully maintained. (Currently it's only being maintained if the module would be useless without)


If there are any features that you'd like to have integrated with bloxy. Please submit an **issue** or dm me on Discord @ **Martini#0001**

Make sure to include as much information as possible to make it easier for me to add it. (I cannot guarantee that I will add it, but it is my call)
