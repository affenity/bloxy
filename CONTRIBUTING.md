When creating an issue, make sure that you follow the instructions below.


#### When creating issues because of the code

1) Create a title and make it sound like what you would say to a friend when you found something (one sentence preferably)

2) Create a short description of the issue, what does it do, (evt. why it could happen)

3) (If possible) A reproduction scenario. (Step-by-step with as many details as possible)

4) Rate how critical it is from 1-10 where 1 is the least critical and 10 is the most critical value.

5) Anything else that I/someone else should know

***

#### When creating issues because you want a feature added

1) Name your title "FEATURE REQUEST: <Short title here>"

2) Describe how it should work

3) Give an explanation for why it should be added to bloxy

4) Create a short code that would show it would be used

5) Anything else that I/someone else should know

#### When creating issues because you want to get help

Please refrain from doing this as I'd like to keep the Issues for actual issues with the repository and not for people who need help on 
how to code. If you need help, you can join the [Roblox API Server here]() or you can DM me @ Martini#0001 (on Discord).
